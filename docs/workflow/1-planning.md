# Step 1: Planning

Every feature starts with a clear plan. We use **Zoho Sprints** to manage our backlog and sprints.

## The Product Owner's Role

Before a ticket reaches an engineer, the Product Owner ensures it is ready for development. A "Ready" release includes:
- [ ] **Deliverable Checklist**: What exactly are we shipping?
- [ ] **Timeline Estimates**: When do we expect this?
- [ ] **Documentation/Designs**: Links to Figma, Eraser.io, or specs.
- [ ] **Portfolio Updates**: Needs for the website (if applicable).

## The Engineer's Role

When you are assigned a ticket:
1. **Read the requirements**. Do you understand what needs to be built?
2. **Check the deliverables**. Are the acceptance criteria clear?
3. **Clarify blockers**. Raise questions early—before writing a single line of code.

## The Goal: Definition of Done

We consider a ticket **Done** only when:
- Acceptance Criteria are met.
- CI checks pass.
- Code is merged to `main`.
- Feature is deployed to production.
- Ticket status is updated in Zoho.
