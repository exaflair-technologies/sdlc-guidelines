# Communication Protocol

We prioritize **Asynchronous Communication**. Deep work requires uninterrupted focus.

## Daily Updates

Post these in your project's Slack channel (e.g., `#proj-alpha`).

**Morning (Before 11:00 AM IST)**
```text
- Today: [Planned tasks]
- Blockers: [Any issues]
```

**Evening (End of Day)**
```text
- Today: [Completed tasks]
- Tomorrow: [Plan for next day]
- Blockers: [Any issues]
```

## Rules of Engagement

1. **No Technical DMs**: Discuss technical issues in public channels or on the ticket. This keeps knowledge visible.
2. **Ticket Status**: Keep Zoho up to date. Automation pushes status changes to Slack, so the team stays informed without you writing a report.
3. **Escalation**: Verbal discussions/calls are reserved for critical blockers or complex architecture alignment.
