# Exaflair Engineering Guidelines

Welcome to the Exaflair Engineering Playbook. This living document outlines how we build, ship, and maintain software.

## Core Philosophy

> **We value shipped code over complex processes.**

However, "shipping" implies the code:
1. **Works**: It meets the user's needs.
2. **Is Secure**: It protects our users and data.
3. **Is Maintainable**: It doesn't slow us down tomorrow.

## The Exaflair Way

Our workflow is designed to be simple and effective:

- **Ownership**: You own your code from design to production.
- **Focus**: We prioritize deep work and asynchronous communication.
- **Velocity**: We use thorough automation (CI/CD) to deploy confidently and often.

- [**Technical Standards**](./standards/coding-practices.md): How we write and structure code.
- [**Pending Decisions**](./decisions/README.md): Active discussions and RFCs.
