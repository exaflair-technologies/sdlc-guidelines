# Decisions & RFCs

This directory tracks significant engineering decisions and "Request for Comments" (RFCs).

## How to use this folder

1. **Pending Decisions**: When a topic (like "Which CI tool?") is being discussed, create a file here.
2. **Transparency**: Decision making happens in the open via Pull Requests to these files.
3. **History**: Once decided, the file serves as a permanent record of *why* we did something.

## Index

- [0001-open-items.md](./0001-open-items.md): Major pending roadmap items.
